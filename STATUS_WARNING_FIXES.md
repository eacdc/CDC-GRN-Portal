# Status Warning Dialog Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Dialog Auto-Closing Issue**
**Problem**: Status warning dialog was closing automatically without user interaction.

**Root Cause**: The dialog was shown asynchronously (`StatusWarningDialog.show()` without await) while the function continued executing, causing UI state changes that dismissed the dialog.

**Solution**: 
- Changed `StatusWarningDialog.show()` to return `Future<void>`
- Added `await` when showing the dialog in AppProvider
- Added `WillPopScope` to prevent accidental dismissal via back button

### 2. ✅ **Proper Flow After Dialog Dismissal**
**Problem**: After closing the status warning, the normal complete/cancel flow wasn't continuing properly.

**Root Cause**: The async dialog wasn't blocking the execution flow, so process refresh and UI updates happened before user acknowledgment.

**Solution**:
- Made dialog await user interaction before continuing
- Ensured process data refresh happens after dialog dismissal
- Maintained proper navigation flow back to process list

## Code Changes

### `lib/widgets/status_warning_dialog.dart`
```dart
// Before
static void show(BuildContext context, String statusMessage, String statusValue) {
  showDialog(context: context, ...);
}

// After  
static Future<void> show(BuildContext context, String statusMessage, String statusValue) async {
  await showDialog<void>(context: context, ...);
}
```

### `lib/providers/app_provider.dart`
```dart
// Before
if (response.hasStatusWarning && _context != null) {
  StatusWarningDialog.show(_context!, ...); // Fire and forget
}
await _refreshProcessData(jobCardContentNo); // Happened immediately

// After
if (response.hasStatusWarning && _context != null) {
  await StatusWarningDialog.show(_context!, ...); // Wait for user
}
await _refreshProcessData(jobCardContentNo); // Happens after dialog
```

## Flow Diagram

### Before (Broken)
```
1. API call completes with status warning
2. Show dialog (async, no wait) ────┐
3. Refresh process data immediately  │
4. UI updates, dialog dismissed ─────┘
5. User never sees dialog properly
```

### After (Fixed)
```
1. API call completes with status warning
2. Show dialog and WAIT for user to click OK
3. Dialog dismissed by user click
4. Refresh process data
5. UI updates with refreshed data
6. Navigation continues normally
```

## Testing Steps

### Test Case 1: Status Warning Display
1. Trigger an operation that returns status-only response
2. **Expected**: Dialog appears and stays visible
3. **Expected**: Dialog cannot be dismissed by tapping outside or back button
4. **Expected**: Dialog only closes when "OK" is clicked

### Test Case 2: Flow Continuation
1. Trigger complete/cancel operation with status warning
2. Click "OK" on status warning dialog
3. **Expected**: Process list refreshes with updated data
4. **Expected**: UI navigates back to process list (for running process screen)
5. **Expected**: Process is removed from running processes list

### Test Case 3: Multiple Status Warnings
1. Trigger multiple operations with status warnings
2. **Expected**: Each dialog waits for user interaction
3. **Expected**: Operations complete in proper sequence

## Debug Output

Added console logging to track the flow:
```
[AppProvider] Status warning detected, showing dialog
[StatusWarningDialog] Showing status warning: [status message]
[StatusWarningDialog] User clicked OK, closing dialog  
[StatusWarningDialog] Dialog dismissed, continuing flow
[AppProvider] Status warning dialog dismissed, continuing
```

## Verification

The fixes ensure:
- ✅ Dialog stays visible until user clicks "OK"
- ✅ Complete/Cancel operations continue after dialog dismissal
- ✅ Process data refreshes after user acknowledgment
- ✅ UI navigation works correctly
- ✅ No race conditions between dialog and data refresh
- ✅ Proper error handling and user feedback

## Impact

- **User Experience**: Status warnings are now clearly visible and require acknowledgment
- **Data Integrity**: Process refreshes happen in correct sequence
- **Navigation**: Proper flow back to process list maintained
- **Reliability**: No more auto-dismissing dialogs or incomplete operations
